# Detecting Concept Drift using Spectral Embedding 
This report is on a novel method of detecting a phenomenon called "concept drift" called unfolded adjacency spectral embedding (UASE), which was introduced by [A. Jones and P. Rubin-Delanchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10455) as a method of embedding complex graphs. Using UASE for this purpose is heavily inspired by two papers by I. Gallagher et al.([1](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/5446f217e9504bc593ad9dcf2ec88dda-Abstract.html),[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05534)). The first uses UASE in the context of a dynamic latent position model, a sequence of unweighted graphs, and the second uses it for a single weighted graph (the specifics are discussed in Section 4). The aim here is to model the relationship between features or covariates changing over time as a weighted dynamic latent position model, a sequence of weighted graphs, and combine the results of those two papers. Obtaining useful insights and properties from this model involves defining a new class of model called a weighted multilayer random dot product graph, which is some weighted extension of the multilayer random dot product graph defined in the [A. Jones and P. Rubin-Delanchy paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10455).
We first explain what concept drift is, why itâ€™s important, and what problems this method aims to solve (Section 1). We then describe the method itself (Section 2) and apply it to a toy model to illustrate its properties (Section 3) before going into detail on the theory behind model and proving some important properties (Section 4).
